# Getting Started

### Reference Documentation

The company has *strict* requirements and blocks most network permissions. The internal network is generally smooth, but there are some restrictions on external networks, such as not allowing access to Baidu, WeChat, QQ, etc.
## Position
To send and receive messages, one can only use internal software. The company's self-developed communication software not only has poor functionality, but also has many limitations.
I originally intended to communicate through logging into internal software, but later I rejected this idea. In fact, most websites also have messaging functions. For example, websites like Zhihu and others.
